# Client Application

Provides GRPC and HTTP APIs to interact with the OCF devices via D2D communication.

| `api.http.tls.certFile` | string | `File path to certificate in PEM format.` | `""` |
| `api.http.tls.clientCertificateRequired` | bool | `If true, require client certificate.` | `true` |

### gRPC API

gRPC API of the client application service as defined [service](./pb/service.proto).

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| `api.grpc.enabled` | bool | `Enable the GRPC API.` | `true` |
| `api.grpc.address` | string | `Listen specification <host>:<port> for grpc client connection.` | `"0.0.0.0:8081"` |
| `api.grpc.enforcementPolicy.minTime` | string | `The minimum amount of time a client should wait before sending a keepalive ping. Otherwise the server close connection.` | `5s`|
| `api.grpc.enforcementPolicy.permitWithoutStream` | bool |  `If true, server allows keepalive pings even when there are no active streams(RPCs). Otherwise the server close connection.`  | `true` |
| `api.grpc.keepAlive.maxConnectionIdle` | string | `A duration for the amount of time after which an idle connection would be closed by sending a GoAway. 0s means infinity.` | `0s` |
| `api.grpc.keepAlive.maxConnectionAge` | string | `A duration for the maximum amount of time a connection may exist before it will be closed by sending a GoAway. 0s means infinity.` | `0s` |
| `api.grpc.keepAlive.maxConnectionAgeGrace` | string | `An additive period after MaxConnectionAge after which the connection will be forcibly closed. 0s means infinity.` | `0s` |
| `api.grpc.keepAlive.time` | string | `After a duration of this time if the server doesn't see any activity it pings the client to see if the transport is still alive.` | `2h` |
| `api.grpc.keepAlive.timeout` | string | `After having pinged for keepalive check, the client waits for a duration of Timeout and if no activity is seen even after that the connection is closed.` | `20s` |
| `api.grpc.tls.caPool` | string | `File path to the root certificate in PEM format which might contain multiple certificates in a single file.` |  `""` |
| `api.grpc.tls.enabled` | bool | `Enable TLS for grpc.` | `false` |
| `api.grpc.tls.keyFile` | string | `File path to private key in PEM format.` | `""` |
| `api.grpc.tls.certFile` | string | `File path to certificate in PEM format.` | `""` |
| `api.grpc.tls.clientCertificateRequired` | bool | `If true, require client certificate.` | `true` |

> Note that the string type related to time (i.e. timeout, idleConnTimeout, expirationTime) is decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m", "h".
